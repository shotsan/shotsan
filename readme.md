Current Research Interests
1. Applying Machine Learning to large scale problems
2. Training Neural Nets and Large Language Models

I was TA for [ECEN 740 Machine Learning](https://ecen740tamu.github.io/) '22 and '24, Primary ML course at Texas A&M Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

I specialize in designing, building, and deploying plug-and-play intelligent systems.


I built Real-Time Voice agents for Learning, [Try it out](https://sarasvi-app.uc.r.appspot.com/)
My recent endevours include working full-time contributing to web agents:  [Amazon Buy For Me](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-shopping-app-buy-for-me-brands)
Worked on web maniputions to benefit agents, scraping for right selectors, addressing challenges in security, inference, and post-training of vision grounding models.

Occasionally developing general navigation and control policies of my [Unitree Go 2](https://shop.unitree.com/products/unitree-go2?srsltid=AfmBOoqcRQqCxSNPKLbUvFpLKRt6Tk1N9kWHanscn7P-5dtgEywKoJiW), and [AR4 6DOF robot](https://www.anninrobotics.com/)
