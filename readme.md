I am a doctoral student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at 
Texas A&M University in College Station. My passion for building cellular networks
was ignited by my master's advisor, Dr. Kiran Kuchi, at IIT Hyderabad. Under his 
guidance, I had the opportunity to develop cellular standards and build prototypes. 
I even demonstrated my first prototype modem at Mobile World Congress in 2017.

Now, I have the privilege of being advised by [Dr. P. R. Kumar](https://cesg.tamu.edu/people-2/faculty/p-r-kumar/), who has helped me hone 
my skills and tackle some of the toughest wireless systems challenges. I specialize in 
designing, building, and deploying plug-and-play wireless systems, with a current 
focus on millimeter-wave communication systems and the unique challenges of indoor 
and outdoor environments.

I have a strong background in 3GPP technologies, including New Radio (5G), 4G-LTE, and 
NB-IoT, and have made contributions to the standards. When I'm not working, you can find 
me indulging in my hobbies as an [avid photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/195237800@N07), ham radio enthusiast with a general 
class license (call sign: KI5AVL), and dedicated FC Barcelona fan who's always ready for a game of football.
