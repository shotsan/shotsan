I am a doctoral student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at 
Texas A&M University in College Station. My passion for building cellular networks
was ignited by my master's advisor, Dr. Kiran Kuchi, at IIT Hyderabad. Under his 
guidance, I had the opportunity to develop cellular standards and build cellular modem 
prototypes. My very first prototype modem was demonstrated at Mobile World Congress'2017, Barcelona. 

Now, I have the privilege of being advised by [Dr. P. R. Kumar](https://cesg.tamu.edu/people-2/faculty/p-r-kumar/), 
who has helped me hone my skills and tackle some of the toughest wireless systems challenges.
I specialize in designing, building, and deploying plug-and-play wireless systems, with a current 
focus on millimeter-wave communication systems.

Over years I developed strong background in 3GPP technologies, including New Radio (5G), 4G-LTE, and 
NB-IoT. Fortunate to have made a few contributions to the standards too. 
When I'm not working, you can find me indulging in my hobbies as an [avid photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/195237800@N07),
ham radio enthusiast, general class license (call sign: KI5AVL). A dedicated FC Barcelona fan, always up for a game of football.
